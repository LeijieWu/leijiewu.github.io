Edge Learning is an emerging distributed machine learning in mobile edge network. Limited works have designed mechanisms to incentivize edge nodes to participate in edge learning. However, their mechanisms only consider myopia optimization on resource consumption, which results in the lack of learning algorithm performance guarantee and longterm sustainability. In this paper, we propose Chiron, an incentive-driven long-term mechanism for edge learning based on hierarchical deep reinforcement learning. First, our optimization goal combines learning-algorithms metric (i.e., model accuracy) with system metric (i.e., learning time, and resource consumption), which can improve edge learning quality under a fixed training budget. Second, we present a two-layer H-DRL design with exterior and inner agents to achieve both long-term and short-term optimization for edge learning, respectively. Finally, experiments on three different real-world datasets are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. In particular, compared with the state-of-the-art methods under the same budget constraint, the final global model accuracy and time efficiency can be increased by 6.5 % and 39 %, respectively. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Joey61Liuyi/Chiron.
